# MonopolyMonteCarlo

I had the idea for this project after we simulated a simple children's game in 
one of my classes. It is a simulation of the game monopoly and is designed to flesh out the
best strategies for the game of monopoly. It involves multiple multi-level functions used to
simulate various stages of game play. In its current state each players game strategy is 
based off a player comfort level randomly assigned to each player at the beginning of the game.
The Monopoly Analysis file contains various insites into the game of monopoly including which
player is the most likely to win depending on what order they begin the game play in, what 
player comfort level is most appropriate, which properties are the most profitable, etc.
